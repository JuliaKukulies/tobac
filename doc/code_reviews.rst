Code reviews
------------------

Before anything is merged into the release branch (:code:`RC_*`), we require that two reviewers accept the code changes of a pull request. 

============================
How to do a code review 
============================

* Checkout out pull request locally

* Run tests locally
  
* Go through code and see if it is readable and easy to understand
  
* Not required, but often useful: test new features with your own data

Conventional comments
=========================

The comments in a code review should be clear and constructive.

A useful way of highlighting the intention of a specific comments is to label them according to `conventional comments <https://conventionalcomments.org/>`_.
