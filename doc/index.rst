tobac - Tracking and Object-Based Analysis of Clouds
-------------------------------------------------------

**tobac** is a Python package to identify, track and analyze clouds in different types of gridded datasets, such as 3D model output from cloud-resolving model simulations or 2D data from satellite retrievals.

The software is set up in a modular way to include different algorithms for feature identification, tracking, and analyses. **tobac** is also input variable agnostic and doesn't rely on specific input variables to work.

In the current implementation, individual features are identified as either maxima or minima in a two-dimensional time-varying field. An associated volume can then be determined using these features with a separate (or identical) time-varying 2D or 3D field and a threshold value. The identified objects are linked into consistent trajectories representing the cloud over its lifecycle in the tracking step. Analysis and visualization methods provide a convenient way to use and display the tracking results.

Version 1.2 of tobac and some example applications are described in a manuscript in Geoscientific Model Development as:

The project is currently being extended by several contributors to include additional workflows and algorithms using the same structure, syntax, and data formats.
