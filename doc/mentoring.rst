Mentoring and Collaboration
----------------------------

============================
Writing code collaboratively
============================

We firmly believe that code can only get better if more than two eyes and one brain work on it. Therefore, we aim to write code collaboratively, in particular, when comprehensive refactoring or enhancements of the code are done. In practice, this can be done by creating a *draft pull request* on the `dev*` branch. As explained in our branch strategy, this branch does not undergo any protection rules, so it is meant to experiment with new code and all contributors can directly push to this branch. Creating a draft pull request has the advantage that you have a platform to communicate with others who contribute to the new feature. You can directly see which changes they make, comment these and discuss ways to go forward.  

==============
Get a mentor
==============

Is it your first time contributing to an open-source project?

Reach out to the **tobac** developer group and get a mentor, one of the developers, who helps you getting started and explain to you how our workflow works. You are always free to post any questions to GitHub discussions, our Slack channel, or write an email. But sometimes it can be nice to have a specific person to refer to when things seem overwhelming in the beginning. 


===============
Pair reviews 
===============

Another great way of collaboration are pair reviews which means that you are reviewing code together with another developer. You can, for example, reach out to us when you have submitted a pull request and would like to talk through the review points with one of the reviewers in order to collaboratively come up with creative solutions to remaining issues. If you are a reviewer, you can offer a pair review to the person who created the pull request and help them addressing certain review points.
